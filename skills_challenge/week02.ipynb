    "- **minutes**: How many minutes into the game when the free throw was taken. An NBA game is 48 minutes long (not counting a potential overtime).\n",

    "- **shot_count**: Some times a player is awarded more than one free throw. A 1 indicates this is their first shot, a 2 indicates this is their second. They can get a maximum of 3 shots."
