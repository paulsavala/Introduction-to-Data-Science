Talk about the parts you think will be difficult (doing the modeling? preparing the data? keeping team members on-task?) and how you plan to address them. Specifically list out goals for yourself in terms of these challenges. I will check in with you throughout the semester on how you are progressing with these goals in order to help you succeed. Talk about why each team member was given each of their duties and responsibilities. Talk about your overall goals for the project. What are the things you are hoping to accomplish for this project to be considered a success? Is it an accuracy goal? Is it being able to explain a complex question in an easy way? Is it to add new insight to an important problem? Be as specific as possible. During your final presentation I will be looking for whether or not you achieved these goals, so they must be clearly defined and not overly broad. Finally, discuss the challenges you had with Project 1, and how you hope to improve on those in Project 2. For example, did your team get off-task and need to cram to finish everything? If so, how will you make sure that's not the case this time?"
